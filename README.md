# Effigy Library

The Effigy Library is a platform for developers *and* gamers to collaborate on improving and sharing ideas to make an even better overall gaming experience. Developers can host their game page on our library platform while recruit other talented individuals through our developer portal all while selling there games to customers.

My vision for the platform is a closed source client application integrated with a API to the server. The API would be open to the public for use so they can integrate it into their games, much like Steam has done with achievements and player invites, etc.
